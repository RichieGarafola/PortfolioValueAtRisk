# PortfolioValueAtRisk
VaR is one way professional traders manage risk. It estimates how much your portfolio might lose over a set time period. Using VaR is a good way to avoid losing all your money if the market moves against you.  VaR lets you say something like this:  "With 95% confidence, my portfolioâ€™s loss will not exceed $750 in one day."
